    "The MoneyBall project give two labelled datasets of successful and unsuccessful companies. One of the features lists the name of all VC investors. Midas is a previous project at Vela that ranked VC investors that invested with a fixed set of \"brand-name\" investors. Aim of the project will be to add the investor ranking as an additional feature of the MoneyBall project dataset and its effect on classification. If there's time combining these results with the beast feature identified from previous interns work to further inmprove the model accuracy."
